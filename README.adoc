= Dotfile README

== Overview

This repository contains my dot configuration files for vim/nvim, screen, bash, and git (gitignore and gitconfig). 
Note that a lot of the settings I use might look weird.
A lot of this is due to the fact that I uses a Kinesis Freestyle keyboard and it's _"optimized"_ for the key placement.
Basically this is the best set of rc files you'll ever find.

== Installing

. Change permissions for `install.sh`
+
`chmod +x install.sh`
